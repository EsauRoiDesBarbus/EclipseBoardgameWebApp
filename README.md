# WebApp for a Eclipse board game simulator

This is a web application for a board game simulator. The game is called [Eclipse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) and it is a 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). The game is played on a hexagonal grid and the players have to manage their resources, research new technologies, build ships and conquer new territories.

This simulator gives the win rate of each player for a given ship battle. The simulator doesn't use a Monte Carlo method to simulate the battle, but it goes through a mathematical model to calculate the win rate.
